# SecTXT: Security.txt parser and validator

This package contains a security.txt ([RFC 9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9116)) parser and validator.

When security risks in web services are discovered by independent security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they often lack the channels to disclose them properly. As a result, security issues may be left unreported. security.txt defines a standard to help organizations define the process for security researchers to disclose security vulnerabilities securely.

## Installation

The package is available on pypi. It can be installed using pip:

```console
> python -m pip install sectxt
```

## Usage

```python

>>> from sectxt import SecurityTXT
>>> s = SecurityTXT("www.example.com")
>>> s.is_valid()
True

```

## Validation

```python

>>> from sectxt import SecurityTXT
>>> s = SecurityTXT("www.example.com")
>>> s.errors
[{'code': 'no_uri', 'message': 'The field value must be an URI', 'line': 2}, {'code': 'no_expire', 'message': 'The Expires field is missing', 'line': None}]
>>> s.recommendations
[{'code': 'long_expiry', 'message': 'Expiry date is more than one year in the future', 'line': 3}]
```

The "errors", "recommendations" and "notifications" attribute return a list of entries. An entry is
a dict with three keys:

| key     | value                                                                                                      |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| code    | A fixed error code string                                                                                  |
| message | A human readable error message in English                                                                  |
| line    | The 1 based integer line number where the error occurred or None when the error applies to the entire file |

| "unknown_field"<sup>[2]</sup> | "security.txt contains an unknown field. Either this is a custom field which may not be widely supported, or there is a typo in a standardised field name." |

---

[1] The security.txt parser will check for the addition of the digital signature, but it will not verify the validity of the signature.

[2] Regarding code "unknown_field": According to RFC 9116 section 2.4, any fields that are not explicitly supported should be ignored. This parser does add a notification for unknown fields by default. This behaviour can be turned off using the parameter recommend_unknown_fields:
```python

>>> from sectxt import SecurityTXT
>>> s = SecurityTXT("www.example.com", recommend_unknown_fields=False)
```
